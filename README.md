# TilBuci Desktop Launcher

TilBuci is a free, open source tool to create interactive content. From a visual web interface, you can gather your media, texts, and all content in the form of interactive "movies" that can be exported as websites, embedded via iframes, made available as PWA apps or even as mobile and desktop applications.

The software is developed as a multi-user web application, but it can also be run as a desktop app using this launcher.

The desktop version is based on the Electron project (https://www.electronjs.org/) and static-php-cli (https://github.com/crazywhalecc/static-php-cli). It can be used as portable software, even running from external drives.

Releases of this project are available for download for Linux, Windows, and Mac (all x64-based) in the TilBuci main repository (https://github.com/lucasjunqueira-var/tilbuci).
